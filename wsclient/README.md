wsclient Project
=======================

#### Description
This project allows a user to interact with ESP services in a controlled manner.  The API calls available under org.hpccsystems.ws.client.platform allow for a user to target ESP's across multiple environments running a range of hpccsystems-platform versions.  There is no guarantee that if a user utilizes org.hpccsystems.ws.client.gen generated stub code from wsdl, that the calls will be backwards compatible with older hpccsystems-platform versions.

#### Maven dependency
To utilize this library as a dependency in your own maven project, simply add the following definition to your pom.xml

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.hpccsystems</groupId>
	<artifactId>wsclient</artifactId>
	<version>7.6.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

#### Build
This project is to be built using Maven. To build the projects using Maven, navigate to the base directory of the project and issue the following command:

`mvn install`

NOTE: wsclient, dfsclient, and commons-hpcc can be built together via the top-level pom file at the JAPI root directory.

Developers who want to do a deployment must insure they have their credentials set in settings.xml under their maven configuration folder.  The following command will execute a clean build of the jar, jar-with-dependencies, javadoc, and source packages.  It will also attempt to sign the packages before uploading them to the sonatype repository for staging.

`mvn clean deploy -P release`

Maintainers can then release the artifacts from staging if the artifacts pass muster.

For more information on how to use Maven see http://maven.apache.org

#### Key elements
- API which Standardize and facilitate interaction with HPCC Web based Services.
- The project is based on stub code generated from WSDLs using Eclipse tools based on Apache Axis and JSch(Java Secure Channel) for secure ftp transfers

WsClient and HPCC Systems versions are now in-sych 


###### 7.6.0 Target September 2019
- JAPI-105 Complete rework based on Axis2 Data Binding (ADB) Framework
  - Actively maintained technology
  - More flexible, efficient and configurable in comparison to Axis1
  - Modern Java version support
  - Lower memory foot print
  - Significantly greater speed than earlier versions of Apache Axis.
  - Java Client code generation has been integrated into maven build processing
  - Junit test coveage has been expanded, and remote test framework has been enhanced
  - All WS Client APIs utilize stable wrappeed classes (callers now shielded from inconsistant generated interfaces)
  - Java 1.8 Compliance
  - WS Client Helper method coverage expanded
  - New WS Clients added
  - Dead code obfuscated
  - Wrapper classes programmatically generated, which provides more consistant interfaces
  - Standardized handling of service-side generated exceptions
  - Base WS Client code utilized to simplify client code
  - All HPCCWsXXXClients have been updated to the latest interfaces based on HPCC Systems 7.6.0 Release
	
This ambitious endeavour, which affected several millions of lines encompassed by many thousands of files, introduces major infrastructure changes which vastly improve this project and was completed with the API-user in mind.
Existing WsClient-based applications are encouraged to migrate to 7.6 WsClient in order to take advantage of all theser new features and enhancements.
The effort to migrate legacy applications could be significant, but for most client it should only requiere some refactoring.

List of changes to consider when migrating pre-7.6  based client applications:
- Direct access to underlying SoapStub is no longer available
- Legacy code utilizing SoapStub objects directly in order to access web service methods should do one of the following:
  - Extend the appropriate HPCCWsXXXClient from the org.hpccsystems.ws.client package, and add helper method
	   or
  - Contibute the helper method logic to the JAPI/wsclient project, or request it as a new feature from the HPCC Systems dev team
- Many HPCCWsXXXClient helper methods' interface has changed to request/respond with a wrapped object
  - This will typically require legacy code to utilze classes from the org.hpccsystems.ws.client.wrappers package
- All org.hpccsystems.ws.client.platform.*Info.java classes deprecated
- Several HPCCWsXXXClient's interface utilized these *Info classes, which were refactored to org.hpccsystems.ws.client.wrappers.*wrapper.java
- All HPCCWsXXXClient helper methods throw java.lang.Exception, ArrayOfEspExceptionWrapper, EspSoapFaultWrapper, and/or ArrayOfECLExceptionWrapper
  - Callers should account for appropriate exception types.
  - The ArrayOf(ECL/ESP)ExceptionWrappers can contain multiple exceptions
