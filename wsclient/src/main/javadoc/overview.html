This project facilitates Java client interaction with HPCC Systems&reg; instances. A wide array of HPCC-centric actions are supported, mostly through HPCC Systems Web Service calls.
The API calls available under org.hpccsystems.ws.client.platform allow for a user to target HPCC Web Services across multiple environments running a range of hpccsystems-platform versions.
The org.hpccsystems.ws.client package contains multiple client libraries which enable callers to easily actuate various HPCC Systems actions.

There is no guarantee that if a user utilizes org.hpccsystems.ws.client.gen generated stub code from wsdl, that the calls will be backwards compatible with older hpccsystems-platform versions.
Users are encouraged to interact with the wrapped versions of all HPCC Systems Web Service requests/responses.
