#### Build
These projects are configured to be built using Maven. To build the projects using Maven, navigate to the base directory of each project and issue the following command:

`mvn install`

NOTE: hpcccommons, wsclient, and dfsclient are controled via the top-level maven pom file and can be built via a single command.
All sub-projects can be built individually using the pom file in each sub-project directory

For more information on how to use Maven see http://maven.apache.org
