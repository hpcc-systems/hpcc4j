## Outcome (from JIRA)
Need access to updated parameters to WURun in HPCC 5.6

{"type": "doc", "version": 1, "content": [{"type": "paragraph", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "HIPIE needs access to the updated parameters available in the 5.6 version of WURun. Can a 5.6 branch of WUClient be created with the HPCC 5.6 axis objects?"}]}]}

## Agent guidance
- Prefer the fixed/updated path; avoid re-introducing previous behavior.
