## Outcome (from JIRA)
Javadoc Test Workflow

{"type": "doc", "version": 1, "content": [{"type": "paragraph", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "pull request workflow to check javadoc builds and throw warnings for user if any of their newly added code doesn't have proper javadoc annotations."}]}]}

## Agent guidance
- Prefer the fixed/updated path; avoid re-introducing previous behavior.
