## Outcome (from JIRA)
Provide jirabot upmerge 

{"type": "doc", "version": 1, "content": [{"type": "paragraph", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "This would be another Jirabot that would automatically upmerge PRs, and would open a new PR in case of conflict"}]}]}

## Agent guidance
- Prefer the fixed/updated path; avoid re-introducing previous behavior.
