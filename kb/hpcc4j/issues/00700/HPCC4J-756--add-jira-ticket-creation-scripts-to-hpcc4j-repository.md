## Outcome (from JIRA)
Add JIRA ticket creation scripts to HPCC4J repository

{"type": "doc", "version": 1, "content": [{"type": "paragraph", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Create PowerShell and Bash scripts to facilitate JIRA ticket creation using Atlassian CLI (acli). Scripts should validate CLI installation, provide interactive confirmation, support common JIRA fields, and follow HPCC4J project conventions for ticket numbering and branch naming."}]}]}

## Agent guidance
- Prefer the fixed/updated path; avoid re-introducing previous behavior.
