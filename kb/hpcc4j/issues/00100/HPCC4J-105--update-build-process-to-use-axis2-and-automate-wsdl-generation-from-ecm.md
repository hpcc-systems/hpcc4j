## Outcome (from JIRA)
Update build process to use axis2 and automate wsdl generation from ecm

{"type": "doc", "version": 1, "content": [{"type": "paragraph", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "The wsclient project is based on WS client code generated by the Apache Axis 1.x tool, which has many limitations and is outdated. Consider integrating axis2 generated WS Client instead"}]}]}

## Agent guidance
- Prefer the fixed/updated path; avoid re-introducing previous behavior.
