The HPCC Systems&reg; Distributed File System Client (DFSClient) Project is a distributed data ingestion and extraction library.
DFSClient exploits internal HPCC Systems binaries on the server-side to efficiently read and write data remotely in parallel.
Supports generic and custom dataset creation and translation through IRecordBuilder and IRecordAccessor interfaces.

Also provides HPCC/Parquet file support via Avro data serialization.
